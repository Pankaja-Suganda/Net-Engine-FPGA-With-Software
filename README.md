# Net Engine FPGA with Software

## Overview

The **Net Engine FPGA with Software** project implements a hardware-accelerated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a custom Net Engine developed in Verilog, accompanied by a driver written in C. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate efficient image processing tasks.

## Features

- **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizes FPGA for fast convolution and max-pooling operations.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Implements the P-Net model for effective face detection.
- **Modular Design**: Organized structure for easy navigation and integration.
- **Extensible**: Easily configurable parameters for different applications and datasets.

## Architecture

The project architecture consists of three key components:

1. **Net Engine (Verilog)**: Performs the convolution and max-pooling operations on input data.
2. **Net Engine Driver (C)**: Manages communication between the processing system and the Net Engine, facilitating data transfer and configuration.
3. **Neural Network**: Implements the P-Net model from the MTCNN framework, providing initial face proposal and landmark prediction.
