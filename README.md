# Net Engine FPGA with Software

## Overview

This project implements a hardware-accelerated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a custom Net Engine in Verilog and a driver in C. The architecture is designed for efficient image processing, specifically for face detection using the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) framework.
